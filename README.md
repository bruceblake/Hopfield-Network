## 💻 For Developers

### Basic Usage
```python
from hopfield_toolkit import HopfieldNetwork
import numpy as np

# Create and train network
network = HopfieldNetwork(n_neurons=100, name="MyNetwork")
patterns = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(5, 100))
stats = network.train_hebbian(patterns)

# Test recall with noise
noisy = network.add_noise(patterns[0], noise_level=0.2)
result = network.recall(noisy)
print(f"Accuracy: {np.mean(result['final_states'] == patterns[0]):.1%}")
```

### Advanced Applications
```python
from applications import PasswordRecovery, PatternCompletion, ImageRestoration

# Password recovery
recovery = PasswordRecovery()
recovery.setup_encoding()
recovery.train_on_passwords(['password123', 'admin2024'])
recovered = recovery.recover_password('p***word')

# Pattern completion
completer = PatternCompletion("text")
completer.train_sequence_patterns(['ABCDABCD', 'BCDBCDBC'])
completed = completer.complete_sequence('ABCD____')

# Image restoration
restorer = ImageRestoration(patch_size=8)
restorer.train_on_image(clean_image)
restored = restorer.restore_image(noisy_image)
```
