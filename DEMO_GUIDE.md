### The 3 Demos:

## 🎨 **MEMORY MAGIC** (Most Visual!)
**What it does:** Shows how AI memorizes and recalls patterns

**What you'll see:**
1. **Step 1:** Draw on a 6x6 grid by clicking squares
   - Watch squares light up as you click
   - See real-time pattern stats
   
2. **Step 2:** Watch AI train with cool animations
   - "Analyzing your pattern..." 
   - "Calculating neural connections..."
   - Progress bar and network visualization
   
3. **Step 3:** Add noise to test AI memory
   - Slide bar to control corruption level
   - See before/after pattern comparison
   
4. **Step 4:** AI restores your pattern!
   - Step-by-step thinking animation
   - "Scanning corrupted pattern..."
   - "Neural network processing..."
   - Perfect restoration with celebration! 🎉

## 🔮 **PATTERN PROPHET** (Super Cool!)
**What it does:** AI predicts what comes next in patterns

**What you'll see:**
- **Pre-made examples** like "ABAB____" → "ABABABAB"
- **Real-time prediction** with confidence levels  
- **Visual analysis** showing known vs unknown positions
- **Custom input** for your own patterns

**Try these:**
- `ABAB____` (alternating pattern)
- `1234____` (number sequence) 
- `AABC____` (letter pattern)

## 🔐 **SECRET DECODER** (Most Impressive!)
**What it does:** AI cracks corrupted passwords like a detective

**What you'll see:**
1. **Secret database** of known passwords
2. **Corrupted codes** to crack like "s___et123"
3. **AI thinking process:**
   - "Scanning corrupted code..."
   - "Accessing memory database..."
   - "Neural pattern matching..."
4. **Perfect decode** with celebration effects!
